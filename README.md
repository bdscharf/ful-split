# ful-split
scripts for splitting radiohead's minidiscs

## usage
Packages managed with [poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/), or you can just install ```wget``` and ```odfpy``` using  PyPI.

Just run ```python main.py```, and the latest version of the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kA8u6UhjbutZ-b7TXzmX4qkOTg6nGC1vPg50WwCcZyo/) will be downloaded, parsed, and written into cue files in the ```cues``` folder.

## help
This is a work-in-progress, but more or less works. A user on the Radiohead subreddit has also done this (manually), and almost certainly has a better version. This is left up as an exercise / general resource.
